Variable = a reserved memory location that lets us store data types and objects.

✅ Python variable naming rules

- Must start with a letter (A–Z or a–z) or an underscore _  --> snake casing is accepted: my_variable
- Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores _
- Cannot start with a number
- Cannot contain special characters** like $, -, *, or spaces
- Is case-sensitive
- variables are mutable = they can change

# Examples of valid variable names:
_message 
my_variable

"""""

first_name= 'John'
#print(first_name) # if we place a print() here than we can print the string 'John' too.
first_name= 'Doe' # this line will overwrite the first_name variable allocating it the 'Doe'.
print(first_name)
