""""" COLLECTIONS:
For storing larger sets of data, Python has Collections.

   Lists are collections of similar items ideally! (like arrays): ["apples", "bread", "eggs"]
        https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list

    If we want to use the lists, we attribute them to a variable:
"""""
shopping_list = ["apples", "bread", "eggs"]
print(shopping_list)

"""""   
    Lists are not data type specific - we CAN have an array with different data types in there - string, integer, float:
     ['String', Integer, Floats, Boolean, ["Another List]]
"""""
random_list = ["any word", 4, 20.8]

"""""  
    Access:
        --> To access a certain element from the list, we access it via the index, which starts at 0, 
        i.e. to access the integer 4 in above:
"""""
print(random_list[1])
""""" 
    Lists are index based:
        --> index [-1] retrieving the last element in the list
"""""
print(random_list[-1])

"""""
    Append method:
 Append the word "milk" to above random_list and print it out:
 """""
random_list.append("milk")
print(random_list)

"""""   Removing items from a list: .pop or .pop(index number)
"""""
random_list.pop()
print(random_list)

random_list.pop(-2)
print(random_list)

removed_item = random_list.pop(1) # we can use the removed item to assign it to a variable and use it later if needed.
print(removed_item)
print(random_list)
