""""" COLLECTIONS:
For storing larger sets of data, Python has Collections.

    Dictionaries = dicts (hashMaps or maps in other languages)
        --> key:value pairs --> we reference the key to access the value.
        
        --> Access: through the key we get the value
        
        --> dictionaries keys are often string values;
        --> dictionaries values can be any data type => strings, numbers, booleans, lists or even embedded dictionaries.

# Working with Dictionaries:

# keys() method:
stock = {
    't-shirts' : 10,
    'dresses' : 15,
    'boots' : 8
}
print(stock.keys())

# values() method:
print(stock.values())

# access a specific value --> get() method:
print(stock.get("dresses"))

# use [] to access items from a dict, similar to using index in a list:
print(stock["t-shirts"])

# adding an item to a dict:
stock["hats"] = 12
print(stock)

# update() method - to change multiple items in the dict
stock.update({"hats": 10, "socks":2})
print(stock)

# pop() method to remove an item from a dict:
stock.pop("dresses")
print(stock)
